Parliament House
, both designed by Baker, are located at the
Sansad Marg
and run parallel to the Rajpath.

Before construction could begin on the rocky ridge of
Raisina Hill
, a circular railway line around the Council House (now
Parliament House
), called the
Imperial Delhi Railway
, was built to transport construction material and workers for the next twenty years. The last stumbling block was the
Agra
-Delhi railway line that cut right through the site earmarked for the hexagonal All-India War Memorial (
India Gate
) and Kingsway (
Rajpath
), which was a problem because the
Old Delhi Railway Station
served the entire city at that time. The line was shifted to run along the
Yamuna River
, and it began operating in 1924. The
New Delhi Railway Station
opened in 1926, with a single platform at
Ajmeri Gate
near
Paharganj
, and was completed in time for the city's inauguration in 1931.
