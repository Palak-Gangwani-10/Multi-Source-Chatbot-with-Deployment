Soon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with
George Swinton
as chairman, and John A. Brodie and
Lutyens
as members, submitted reports for both north and south sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at
India Gate
, was previously meant to be a north–south axis linking the
Viceroy's House
at one end with
Paharganj
at the other. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites on the north side, the committee settled on the south site.

was chosen for the
Rashtrapati Bhavan
, then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this choice was that the hill lay directly opposite the
Dinapanah
citadel, which was also considered the site of
Indraprastha
, the ancient region of Delhi. Subsequently, the foundation stone was shifted from the site of
Delhi Durbar
of 1911–1912, where the Coronation Pillar stood, and embedded in the walls of the forecourt of
the Secretariat
. The
Rajpath
, also known as King's Way, stretched from the
India Gate
to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. T
