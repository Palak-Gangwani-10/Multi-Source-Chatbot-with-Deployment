] History Kundan Lal Jaggi
and
Kundan Lal Gujral
were both
Punjabi Hindu
migrants from
Peshawar
, who had already invented the
butter chicken
in the
Moti Mahal
restaurant, in the
Daryaganj
neighborhood of
Old Delhi
, during the early 1950s, after the
Partition of India
. They were now looking to create a
vegetarian
dish that would complement it. A regular diner at the restaurant that Jaggi and Gujral ran suggested that something exciting could be created out of
urad dal
commonly used in traditional dishes, leading to the invention of
dal makhani
. [

] Preparation Dal makhani is traditionally prepared by first soaking
urad dal
and
red kidney beans
(rajma) overnight. The soaked lentils and beans are then boiled or pressure-cooked until tender. [
