History

Kundan Lal Jaggi
and
Kundan Lal Gujral
were both
Punjabi Hindu
migrants from
Peshawar
, who had already invented the
butter chicken
in the
Moti Mahal
restaurant, in the
Daryaganj
neighborhood of
Old Delhi
, during the early 1950s, after the
Partition of India
. They were now looking to create a
vegetarian
dish that would complement it.

A regular diner at the restaurant that Jaggi and Gujral ran suggested that something exciting could be created out of
urad dal
commonly used in traditional dishes, leading to the invention of
dal makhani
.
[

]

Preparation

Dal makhani is traditionally prepared by first soaking
urad dal
and
red kidney beans
(rajma) overnight. The soaked lentils and beans are then boiled or pressure-cooked until tender.
[

]

Separately, a
tadka
(tempered oil mixture) is prepared by heating
ghee
in a pot, then adding onions, a
bay leaf
, and an optional cardamom pod. The onions are sautéed until golden brown, and ginger-garlic paste is added until the raw aroma dissipates. Tomato puree, Kashmiri chili powder, and
garam masala
are stirred into the mixture and cooked until the oil separates.
[

]

The boiled lentils and beans are then combined with the masala and simmered on low heat, occasionally mashing some of the lentils to achieve a creamy texture.
Kasuri methi
(dried fenugreek leaves) and butter are added toward the end, and the dish is cooked until thick and creamy.
[

]

Dal makhani is typically garnished with a small amount of cream or yogurt and chopped coriander. It is commonly served with
jeera rice
(cumin-flavored rice) or
naan
.

"The modern dal makhani was invented by Moti Mahal by Vir Sanghvi"
.
Gautam's theory is that the Punjabis of east Punjab and of Lahore did not make a whole urad dal. This was the specialty of Punjabis in Peshawar. Dhabas (there were relatively few restaurants in those days) sold a black dal made with whole urad and served with a few rotis.When the Peshawaris came over after the Partition, they brought this dal with them. As many Peshawari Punjabis became restaurateurs, this was the dal they put on their menus

It's amazing that one chef and one restaurant in Delhi lay claim to creating so many of the dishes that are now seen as Indian signatures around the world, such as butter chicken, Seekh kebab, barrah kebab and this vegetarian lentil and kidney bean dish (dal makhani). So, all hail to chef Kundan Lal Jaggi, his partners Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Mago, and the pioneering kitchens of the Moti Mahal in Delhi.
